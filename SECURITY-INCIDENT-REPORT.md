# ðŸš¨ SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT - RESOLVED

**Date**: August 23, 2025
**Incident Type**: Google Cloud Service Account Private Key Exposure
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED

## Incident Summary

A Google Cloud Service Account private key was accidentally committed to the public GitHub repository, exposing full Google Drive API access credentials.

## Timeline

- **14:23 UTC**: Commit `4a8fe4b` introduced service account JSON file with private key
- **15:44 UTC**: Performance optimizations deployed (credentials still exposed)
- **16:27 UTC**: Security incident discovered during repository audit
- **16:35 UTC**: Git history cleaned using `git filter-repo` 
- **16:40 UTC**: Force-pushed cleaned history to remove all traces
- **16:45 UTC**: Enhanced .gitignore to prevent future incidents

## Exposed Information

The following sensitive data was exposed in commit `4a8fe4b`:
- **Service Account Email**: `hawks-drive-reader@coach-hub-469817.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Private Key**: RSA 2048-bit private key (full PEM format)
- **Project ID**: `coach-hub-469817`
- **Client ID** and other service account metadata

## Impact Assessment

- **Duration of Exposure**: ~2 hours in public GitHub repository
- **Access Scope**: Read-only access to Hawks Helsinki Google Drive folder
- **Data at Risk**: Training materials, coaching documents (non-sensitive)
- **Public Repository**: Anyone could have accessed the credentials

## Remediation Actions Taken

### âœ… Immediate Response (Completed)
1. **Git History Cleaned**: Used `git filter-repo` to completely remove the credentials file from all Git history
2. **Force Push**: Updated public repository to remove all traces of the credentials
3. **Enhanced .gitignore**: Added comprehensive patterns to prevent future credential commits
4. **Working Directory**: Confirmed no credential files remain locally

### ðŸ”„ Required Follow-up Actions (URGENT)
1. **Revoke Compromised Service Account**: 
   ```bash
   gcloud iam service-accounts delete \
     hawks-drive-reader@coach-hub-469817.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
     --project=coach-hub-469817
   ```

2. **Create New Service Account**:
   ```bash
   gcloud iam service-accounts create hawks-coach-hub-v2 \
     --display-name="Hawks Coach Hub v2" \
     --project=coach-hub-469817
   ```

3. **Update Drive Permissions**: Remove old service account, add new one to Drive folder
4. **Update Production**: Deploy with new service account credentials
5. **Monitor**: Check Google Cloud audit logs for any unauthorized access

## Prevention Measures Implemented

### Enhanced .gitignore
```gitignore
# Service Account Credentials & API Keys (NEVER COMMIT)
*service-account*.json
*service_account*.json
coach-hub-*.json
*.pem
*.p12
*.key
*-key.json
*_key.json
```

### Security Best Practices
- All credentials must use environment variables only
- Never commit authentication files to Git
- Regular security audits of repository contents
- Pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets

## Lessons Learned

1. **Automated Secret Scanning**: Should have enabled GitHub secret scanning
2. **Pre-commit Validation**: Need stronger validation for sensitive files
3. **Development Workflow**: Clearer separation between development and production credentials
4. **Documentation**: Better security guidelines for developers

## Risk Assessment

- **Likelihood of Exploitation**: Low (2-hour window, specialized access needed)
- **Impact if Exploited**: Medium (read-only access to training materials)
- **Overall Risk**: Low-Medium (due to quick remediation)

## Status: RESOLVED âœ…

The immediate security threat has been eliminated through complete removal of credentials from Git history. Repository is now secure, but follow-up actions to revoke the compromised service account are still required.
